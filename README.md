# 🐍 Classic Snake Game (OOPS Version)

A recreation of the classic Arcade Snake Game built entirely in Python. This project focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to create modular, readable, and scalable code.

## 🎮 Game Features

* **Classic Mechanics:** Control the snake, eat food, and grow longer without hitting the walls or yourself.
* **Score Tracking:** Real-time score updates and High Score tracking during the session.
* **Smooth Controls:** Responsive keyboard inputs for movement.
* **OOP Architecture:** The game logic is split into distinct classes for better organization.

# 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied

This project was built to practice and demonstrate key Object-Oriented concepts:

* **Classes & Objects:** Created distinct blueprints for the `Snake`, `Food`, and `Scoreboard`.
* **Inheritance:** Inherited from the `Turtle` class to create custom game objects.
* **Modularity:** Separated code into different files (modules) to keep `main.py` clean.
* **Encapsulation:** Managed attributes (like score and segments) within their respective classes.
